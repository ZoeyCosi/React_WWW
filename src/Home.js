                    <p id="homeP">The goal of this project is to show the beauty of the world of taxonomy. <br/><br/>
                    Taxonomy is the study of dividing life into categories that are appropriate. This use to be done by shared <br/>
                    characteristics suchs as similar beaks or fur patterns, but obviously this could lead to false equivalencies! <br/>
                    Taxonomy can be blurry
                    and seem very arbitrary, but it helps scientists create a network of life and shows <br/>
                    that we all are related in some way, 
                    be it that we are both eukaryotic species or the fact that we<br/>
                     are both mammals, we all have something in common.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    As said before, the lines can seem like they're arbitrary but they matter.<br/>
                    For example, Bats have wings and so do 
                    blue jays, so are they both birds? are they similar? <br/>of course not! Blue jays are birds! They lay eggs, they have 
                    feathers, and make nests...<br/> all stuff bats don't do, but all the stuff bats do is similar to what cows, dogs, and 
                    even we do!
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Scientists now use DNA to know exactly how to order things properly.<br/>
                    They can see similariesties in the DNA structure and know if two species are closely related.<br/>
                    This can help with species that look similar or even identical such as bacterium!<br/>
                    Taxonomy is crazy!<br/>
